# React Native Case Studies

If you're new to React Native, there's a huge chance you've been warned that it's not the way to go for fresh and responsive mobile apps. I've asked a few experienced React Native engineers, and it turns out performance is not going to be your problem if you're making simple apps.

But then, I've lately been reading case studies of companies using React Native to build complex apps for thousands of users. This repo is a collection of all those case studies all in one place. Enjoy!
